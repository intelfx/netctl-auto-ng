netctl-auto-wireless: An extended automatic wireless management script.

Usage:
	$(basename "$0") [OPTIONS] <target> [interface]

Options:
	-q, --quiet:     Suppress non-error messages.
	--running:       Require the current state to be "running".
	--suspended:     Require the current state to be "suspended" or "running".

States:
	There are three dedicated states of the script/daemon:
	 - running   (scanning is active)
	 - suspended (scanning is stopped, networks are disconnected)
	 - halted    (technically same as suspended)

	Their purpose is to allow commands to the script to be skipped
	automatically in a conditional manner (using options described above).

Targets:
	A target is the desired operation mode of the script.
	It may be one of the following:

	continuous:  Scan for networks endlessly, connecting to first found one.
	once:        Scan for networks once (for a timeout), connecting to first
	             found network and exiting as soon as the connection gets lost.

	halt:        Stop the scanner daemon and disconnect from any network.
	suspend:     Same as halt, but go to state "suspended".

	last:        Go to the last active mode (either "continuous" or "once").
	resume:      Same as last, but require the state to be "suspended".
	             This target is made for readability.

	reconfigure: Re-read network profiles.

	status:      Print (pretty-print, if on terminal) the connection info.
	status wpa:  Same as "status", but also print information from
	             wpa_supplicant (if connected).
				 If field names are given after "wpa", print them only
				 (otherwise, print all fields).

	bootup:      Auto-configure the daemon in a mode acceptable for a
	             system boot sequence.
	power:       Auto-configure the daemon in a mode acceptable for a
	             power source transition (battery <-> AC).

	For two latest targets, see the configuration file.

Interface specification:
	A single network interface may or may not be specified.

	If specified, it overrides any other setting.
	Otherwise, the interface name is read from the following places:
	- /run/network/netctl-auto-wireless-ng.interfaces
	- /etc/conf.d/netctl (\$WIRELESS_INTERFACE)

Exit codes:
	0: done or nothing to do
	1: error while processing options or configuration files
	2: unsufficient privileges or locking failed
	3: interface init failed
	4: timeout/abort while waiting for an established connection ("once" mode)

Configuration files:
	Native configuration file:  /etc/conf.d/netctl-auto-wireless
	Netcfg configuration file:  /etc/conf.d/netctl
	Network profiles directory: /etc/network.d
